This repository includes a dice game which is totally based on javascript.

It is a dice game generally called pig game. This is a two player game in which each player can roll the dice as many times as he wishes
to but if one occurs all his round score wil become zero and will not be added in the global score.

A player can pass on its turn also after any number of dice rolls, if his pass is successful then his round score will get added up in
the global score.

Player that first reaches to the final score will be the winner of the game.

Lets play!
